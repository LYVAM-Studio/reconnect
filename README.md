# ReConnect

## About the game

ReConnect is an Unity powered game project. It uses PUN (Photon Unity Networking) for the multiplayer side.

It is currently based on this [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dnTnykgwKs). Feel free to watch it if you want to understand better the project.

## About versioning

Please avoid merge conflicts! Note that, for everything that is not code (e. g. 3D model, assets, ...), resolving conflicts is **no possible**. It is only possible on text files such as code.
